# You will use a Jupyter notebook to create your first program.
# Your senior officer wants you to create code to perform a couple of utilities.
# You will start by displaying today's date.
# Then you will add code to convert parsecs to lightyears.

# This exercise is broken into a series of steps.
# For each step you will be presented with the goal for the step,
# followed by an empty cell.
# Enter your Python into the cell and run it.
# The solution for each step will follow each cell.
